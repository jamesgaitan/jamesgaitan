Hi, I'm James Gaitan. I'm a computer engineer interested in systems software and embedded software engineering. I've worked as a systems software engineer 
at Hughes Network Systems where I made extensive use of Intel [AVX-512 instructions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-avx-512-instructions.html),
the [VTune profiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler.html#gs.d506ko), and the Intel [I64 and IA-32 
architecture optimization reference manual](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/manual/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf).

I'm currently working at BlueHalo as an embedded software engineer where I mainly develop firmware and drivers for Nordic and STM32 devices in C/C++.

My interests right now are mostly in compiler engineering, but I'm also interested in HPC and GPUs. I read many books, blogs, and articles on computer 
engineering. At the moment I'm reading books on compilers and am aiming to start contributing to LLVM, GCC, and CLang.

My favorite languages are C, C++, Python, and Rust.
