Hi, I'm James Gaitan. I'm a computer engineer interested in systems software and embedded software engineering. I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in computer engineering. I've worked as a systems software engineer 
at Hughes Network Systems where I made extensive use of Intel [AVX-512 instructions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-avx-512-instructions.html),
the [VTune profiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler.html#gs.d506ko), and the Intel [I64 and IA-32 
architecture optimization reference manual](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/manual/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf).

I'm currently working at BlueHalo as an embedded software engineer where I mainly develop firmware and drivers for Nordic and STM32 devices in C/C++, targeting ARM Cortex-M3 processors.

My interests right now are mostly in compiler engineering, but I'm also interested in HPC and GPUs. I read many books, blogs, and articles on computer 
engineering. At the moment I'm reading books on compilers and am aiming to start contributing to LLVM, GCC, and CLang.
